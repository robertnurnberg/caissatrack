Track the evaluations of the 100k most popular positions in

found in [`caissa_sorted_100000.epd`](caissa_sorted_100000.epd), where they
appear in sorted order according to popularity. For example, the starting
positions appears first. Thanks to Joost VandeVondele for preparing
the file `caissa_sorted_100000.epd` in July 2023.
